# CV Project 2025
Computer Vision Fall 2025 project for generating frames of Pong or Tetris based off of key board actions in real time.

## To Do

- [ ] Set up a Pong model to be used within our model. This should have an API to be used within our pipeline to move the paddle.
    - ALE Gymnaisum Pong API: https://ale.farama.org/environments/pong/
    - ALE models: https://ale.farama.org/environments/

- [ ] Pick our transformer encoder model and implement in using PyTorch
    - ViT

- [ ] Pick our transformer decoder model and implement using PyTorch.
    - DiT

- [ ] Get comfortable on HPC Greene and do a test train.
